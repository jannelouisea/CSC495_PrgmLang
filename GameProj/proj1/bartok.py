Bartok Requirements:
 A standard deck of cards (without Jokers)
 2 to 5 players
 5 to 7 card to start
Game Play:
 The first player to get rid of all cards from their hand wins.
 Each player is initially dealt five to seven cards.
 Players place cards in the center Pile.
 After dealing cards to each player, the top card from the deck is placed
 face up in the center.
 Each player must place a card matching the suit or rank of the 
 top card of the center pile.
 If a player cannot place a card, they must draw one card from the deck (This is done automatically).
 If the top card is a Draw 2 card (i.e. card with rank 2) and the player cannot
 add another Draw 2 card, they must draw n cards from the deck where n equals the number
 of cumulative Draw 2 cards * 2 (This is also done automatically).
