SPOONS_SUMMARY = '''
Let's play Spoons!
Spoons Requirements:
A standard deck of cards (without Jokers)
3 to 13 players
Game Play:
The first person with four matching cards wins.
Each player is dealt four cards.
The dealer (Player 1) takes a card off the top of the deck to have five cards in their hand
They remove one card and pass it to the left.
Each person discards to the person on the left.
If you are the last player, you discard to the trash pile.
If the deck ever runs out, the trash pile is shuffled and replaces the deck.
If you have four matching cards in your hand, you must discard the fifth non-matching card to win the game.
